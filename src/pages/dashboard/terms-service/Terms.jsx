                            access to the Lunata website platform Services must
                            create a "family" account, which will certify that the individual creating the
                            "family" account is of 18 years of age and as such, the parent or legal
                            guardian of any child or children registered under the "family" account. As the
                            creator of the "family" account, s/he is thereby granting permission for
                            his/her child or children to access the various Services provided, including,
                            but not limited to, message boards, email, and/or instant messaging. It is the

                            Services and/or content provided are age-appropriate for his/her child.
